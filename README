Claudia is an UCI chess engine written in C, with the purpose of serving as an exercise in chess programming techniques.


USAGE

Claudia runs as a console application and can be used with any chess GUI that supports the UCI protocol. It is known to compile with gcc (both 64 and 32 bits systems) and Visual C++, has been thoroughly tested with Arena, and should be fairly stable right now.


ALGORITHM

The engine uses:

	* 0x88 internal board representation,
	* bitboards for pawn structure evaluation;
	* a single threaded negamax algorithm
	* alpha-beta pruning,
	* iterative deepening,
	* aspiration windows,
	* principal variation search,
	* null move pruning,
	* lazy evaluation,
	* quiescent search,
	* check extensions,
	* static exchange evaluation,
	* killer moves heuristic
	* transposition tables.

Its leaf evaluation function is still very rudimentary; currently it takes into account material advantage, piece mobility and pawn structure, and lacks most specific ending knowledge.

Claudia supports opening books in Polyglot (.bin) format, and will attempt to use an opening book named "book.bin" and placed in its same directory. The default book has been built from over forty thousand high-quality tournament games played by Grand Masters and International Masters over the last five years.


NAME

Claudia is obviously named after Claude E. Shannon (1916 - 2001).
